## Features

- Floating translation button
- Editable bilingual display
- User-defined non-translatable areas
- User-defined API Key (BYOK), powered by OpenAI-compatible LLM translation
- Built-in cloud dictionaries with support for self-hosting
- Crowdin integration, allowing community translation via the web without Obsidian
- Full i18n support—automatically adapts to the user interface language (currently Simplified Chinese and English)

## Configuration

### Quick Start

#### Install the plugin

This plugin is not yet on the official Obsidian marketplace. Install via BRAT or manually.

**Manual installation:** Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the `release` page and copy them to:  
`<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/aqu-kiss-translator/`.

#### Beginners: Using cloud dictionaries only

![](docs/快速上手说明.webp)

1. Open Obsidian Settings  
2. Navigate to **KISS Translator**  
3. Click the refresh button beside **Registry URL** to load cloud dictionaries  
4. Search or browse for the dictionary you want  
5. Click **Download**  
6. After downloading, switch pages and the dictionary will auto-inject  
   (If the floating button is red, double-click it to toggle)

### Advanced Users: Using AI Translation

![](docs/API配置.webp)

Normally you only need to configure:

- API URL: OpenAI-compatible endpoint, e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- API Key: e.g. `sk-xxx`
- Model: e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`

Then open the page you want to translate, right-click the floating button, and select **Translate current page**.

#### Floating Button Menu Explained

1. Trigger a translation. Requires API Key. Translates line-by-line. The active line shows a blue breathing dot. Results are saved to the **active dictionary**.  
2. When enabled, an edit icon appears after each translated entry  
3. Hide original text  
4. Show original text on hover (only available when original text is hidden)  
5. Three recently used dictionaries for quick switching  
6. Create a new dictionary (**Settings must be closed** to input a name)  
7. Dictionary list — double-click to set the **active dictionary**

### Advanced Users: Crowdin Integration

Join the project:  
[Obsidian Plugin Translation Project — Unofficial](https://crowdin.com/project/obsidian-plugin-i18n/invite?h=8898cc9f7e6770a327a4370b9cff861d2632512)

#### Extract original text

Enable **Extract Only** to write only source text into dictionaries, without calling AI. Useful for batch extraction.

#### Upload original text

Two methods:

- **Via GitHub PR (requires review):**  
  Fork this repo → find extracted dictionary in  
  `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/aqu-kiss-translator/translation`  
  (e.g. `Admonition.json`) → place it into the repo’s `translations/en` → submit PR

- **Via Crowdin (requires permissions):**  
  Upload source files directly into the corresponding Crowdin directory

#### Translating in Crowdin

Crowdin automatically syncs with GitHub every hour (manual sync for high-permission users).  
Once synced, translations can be edited directly in the web UI.

#### Crowdin Batch Translation Workflow

Extract source → upload to Crowdin → AI pre-translation → dictionary auto-sync to GitHub →  
maintainer reviews & approves PR → GitHub Action updates registry →  
users download cloud dictionaries in plugin

## Development / Build

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Development watch: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Known Limitations

- Translating text blocks with links may break clickable behavior. Such nodes are skipped by default.
- Only visible areas can be extracted, resulting in imperfect coverage for commands, popups, etc.

## Roadmap

- Publish to the official marketplace
- Visual dictionary import/export  
- Interactive onboarding with animations

## Acknowledgements

- Inspired by [fishjar/kiss-translator](https://github.com/fishjar/kiss-translator).

## Notes

- The immersive translation SDK is no longer public, so a custom implementation is used.
- Previous i18n plugin could not be published due to core modification; this plugin is fully non-intrusive.

## Vibe Coding Disclaimer

Most of the development was completed using AI.
